# Vortex
## What is Vortex
No key storage. No key exchange. Robust security scheme for all your data needs, with real time key calculation based AES encryption.

## How is this achieved?
Majority of security attacks against encrypted data happen around key storage and/or key exchange. For a fast symmetric encryption scheme like AES, this is even more crucial. To mitigate the side attacks, what if the keys are generated in real time? What if the key generation is based on predetermined, shared information, so there's no need for any exchange? Vortex provides both features for AES key and initial vector generation, so your system no longer needs to store or transmit any secret.
